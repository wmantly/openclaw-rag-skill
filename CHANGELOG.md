# Changelog

All notable changes to the OpenClaw RAG Knowledge System will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- Initial release of RAG Knowledge System for OpenClaw
- Semantic search using ChromaDB with all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings
- Multi-source indexing: sessions, workspace files, skill documentation
- CLI tools: rag_query.py, rag_manage.py, ingest_sessions.py, ingest_docs.py
- Python API: rag_query_wrapper.py for programmatic access
- Automatic integration wrapper: rag_context.py for transparent RAG queries
- RAG-enhanced agent wrapper: rag_agent.py
- Type filtering: search by document type (session, workspace, skill, memory)
- Document management: add, delete, reset collection
- Batch ingestion with intelligent chunking
- Session parser for OpenClaw event format
- Automatic daily updates via cron job
- Comprehensive documentation: README.md, SKILL.md

### Features
- **Semantic Search**: Find relevant context by meaning, not keywords
- **Local Vector Store**: ChromaDB with persistent storage (~100MB per 1,000 docs)
- **Zero Dependencies**: No API keys required (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 is free and local)
- **Smart Chunking**: Messages grouped by 20 with overlap for context
- **Multi-Format Support**: Python, JavaScript, Markdown, JSON, YAML, shell scripts
- **Automatic Updates**: Scheduled cron job runs daily at 4:00 AM UTC
- **State Tracking**: Avoids re-processing unchanged files
- **Debug Mode**: Verbose output for troubleshooting

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed duplicate ID errors by including chunk_index in hash generation
- Fixed session parser to handle OpenClaw event format correctly
- Fixed metadata conversion errors (all metadata values as strings)

### Performance
- Indexing speed: ~1,000 docs/minute
- Search time: <100ms (after embedding load)
- Embedding model: 79MB (cached locally)
- Storage: ~100MB per 1,000 documents

### Documentation
- Complete SKILL.md with OpenClaw integration guide
- Comprehensive README.md with examples and troubleshooting
- Inline help in all CLI tools
- Best practices and limitations documented

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- `package.json` with complete OpenClaw skill metadata
- `CHANGELOG.md` for version tracking
- `LICENSE` (MIT) for proper licensing

### Changed
- `package.json` explicitly declares NO required environment variables (fully local system)
- Documented data storage path: `~/.openclaw/data/rag/`
- Enhanced `README.md` with clearer installation instructions
- Added references to CHANGELOG, LICENSE, and package.json in README
- Clarified that no API keys or credentials are required

### Documentation
- Improved documentation transparency to meet security scanner best practices
- Clearly documented the fully-local nature of the system (no external dependencies)

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-12

### Fixed
- **Hard-coded paths**: Replaced all absolute paths with dynamic resolution
  - `rag_context.py`: Now uses `os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))`
  - `scripts/rag-auto-update.sh`: Uses `$HOME`, `OPENCLAW_DIR`, and relative paths
  - Removed hard-coded `/home/william/.openclaw/` references
  - All scripts now portable across different user environments

### Changed
- **Documentation**: Updated SKILL.md with path portability notes
  - Documented that all paths use dynamic resolution
  - Confirmed no custom network calls or external telemetry
  - Added "Network Calls" section addressing security scan concerns
- **rag_query_wrapper.py**: Removed hard-coded path example from docstring

### Security
- Verified: `rag_system.py` has no network calls (only imports chromadb)
- Verified: `scripts/rag-auto-update.sh` has no network activity
- Confirmed: ChromaDB telemetry is disabled (`anonymized_telemetry=False`)
- Confirmed: All processing and storage is local-only

### Addressed Feedback
- Fixed ClawHub security scan concerns about hard-coded paths
- Fixed concerns about missing code review (rag_system.py is fully auditable)
- Documented network behavior (only model download by ChromaDB on first run)

---

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- API documentation indexing from external URLs
- Automatic re-indexing on file system events (inotify)
- Better chunking strategies for long documents
- Integration with external vector stores (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Webhook notifications for automated content processing
- Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
- Query history and analytics
- Export/import of vector database

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- YAML front matter to SKILL.md with `name: rag` and `description` for ClawHub compatibility
- `Security Considerations` section documenting privacy implications and sensitive data risks
- `scripts/rag-auto-update.sh` included in skill package (previously in separate location)
- `.skill` package for ClawHub distribution (28KB, 14 files)

### Changed
- Updated package.json description to match SKILL.md front matter
- Documented auto-update script behavior for security review (local-only ingestion)
- Clarified ChromaDB storage location and data deletion procedures

### Fixed
- **Cron job HTTP 500 errors**: Changed from `sessionTarget: "main"` to `isolated` to avoid flooding chat with thousands of lines of output
- **Cron schedule**: Fixed from `0 4 * * *` to `0 0 * * *` to match actual midnight UTC execution time

### Security
- Documented that RAG indexes all session transcripts and workspace files (may contain API keys, credentials, private messages)
- Added recommendations for privacy-conscious use: review sessions before ingestion, use `rag_manage.py reset` to delete all indexed data
- Confirmed auto-update script only runs local ingestion scripts - no remote code fetching

### Documentation
- Added detailed security warnings in SKILL.md
- Explained how to delete ChromaDB persistence directory (`~/.openclaw/data/rag/`)
- Provided guidance on redacting sensitive data before ingestion
